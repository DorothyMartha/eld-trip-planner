## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Debugging**

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your application: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Press **F12** (or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Click on the **Console** tab
4. Clear any old messages (click trash icon)

### Step 2: Enter Trip Details
```
Current Location: Kampala
Pickup Location: Jinja
Dropoff Location: Mbarara
Current Cycle: 20
```

### Step 3: Click "Calculate Trip"

### Step 4: Check Console Output

You should see something like this:

```javascript
✅ GOOD OUTPUT:
--------------
Trip data received: {current_location: "Kampala", pickup_location: "Jinja", ...}

Building route with: {
  current: "Kampala",

## ⚠️ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "No coordinates found for [Location]"
```
❌ BAD OUTPUT:
Looking up: "Kampala" -> "kampala"
No coordinates found for Kampala, using default
⚠️ Could not find coordinates for current location: Kampala
```

**Solution:**
- The city name might be misspelled
- Check the spelling in your input
- Try variations: "Kampala", "kampala", "KAMPALA"
- If it's a small town, add it to the database

### Issue 2: Current Location Marker Not Added
```
❌ BAD OUTPUT:
Current location coords: null
⚠️ Could not find coordinates for current location: [Your City]
```

**Solution:**
- The location name is not in the database
- Check console to see what name was tried
- Add the location to `getCityCoordinates()` function
- Or use a nearby major city

### Issue 3: Marker Shows But Wrong Position
```
✓ Added current location marker at: [0.3476, 32.5825]
BUT marker appears somewhere else on map
```

**Solution:**
- Check if coordinates are correct
- Verify latitude/longitude order: [lat, lng]
- Look at map tiles loading properly
- Try zooming in to verify position

### Issue 4: No Markers Show At All
```
Final route: {
  totalMarkers: 0,
  markers: []
}
```

**Solution:**
- None of the locations were found
- Check your spelling
- Try using locations from UGANDA_COVERAGE.md
- Refresh the page and try again

## 🗺️ **Verify Marker on Map**

### Visual Checklist:

1. **Look for Blue Pulsing Circles:**
   - Should be at your current location
   - Larger than other markers (50x50px)
   - Gentle pulse animation
   - Bright blue color

2. **Check Position:**
   - Is it where the city should be?
   - Zoom in to verify
   - Compare with map labels

3. **Click the Marker:**
   - Popup should say: "📍 You Are Here"
   - Shows location name
   - Blue info box: "✓ Current Location"

✅ Mbarara   [-0.6031, 30.6584]
✅ Gulu      [2.7747, 32.2989]

## 📊 **Console Commands**

Open console and try these:

```javascript
// Check if markers exist
console.log(document.querySelectorAll('.custom-icon.current'));
// Should show: NodeList [div.custom-icon.current]

// Check Leaflet markers
console.log(document.querySelectorAll('.leaflet-marker-icon'));
// Should show all markers on map
```

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Actions**

### If Marker Doesn't Appear:

**Action 1: Hard Refresh**
- Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows/Linux)
- Or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
- This clears cache and reloads everything

**Action 2: Check Console for Errors**
- Look for red error messages
- If you see any, copy and share them

**Action 3: Verify Location Name**
- Try "Kampala" (known working city)
- If Kampala works, your location might not be in database

**Action 4: Check Network Tab**
- In DevTools, go to "Network" tab
- Look for the API call to `/api/calculate-trip/`
- Check the response data
- Verify `map_data.current_location` is correct

## 🎯 **Expected Console Output**

### Minimal Working Example:

```javascript
// When you enter: Kampala → Jinja
Building route with: {current: "Kampala", pickup: "Jinja", dropoff: "Jinja"}
Looking up: "Kampala" -> "kampala"
Found coordinates for Kampala: [0.3476, 32.5825]
✓ Added current location marker at: [0.3476, 32.5825]

Final route: {
  totalMarkers: 2,  // Current + Dropoff
  markers: [
    {id: "current-location", type: "current", ...},
    {id: "dropoff-location", type: "dropoff", ...}
  ]
}
```

## 📞 **What to Share If Still Not Working**

If the marker still doesn't appear, share these from console:

1. **Location lookup output:**
   ```
   Looking up: "..." -> "..."
   Found/Not found: ...
   ```

2. **Final route output:**
   ```
   Final route: { totalMarkers: ?, markers: [...] }
   ```

3. **Any error messages** (red text in console)

4. **Screenshot of the map** (showing what you see)
