## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Detection**
- System reads your "Current Location" input
- Looks up city coordinates in database
- Places pulsing marker at exact location

### 2. **Visual Distinction**
- **Larger**: 40x40px vs 28x28px for other markers
- **Animated**: Gentle pulse every 2 seconds
- **Glowing**: Subtle blue glow effect
- **Different color**: Bright sky blue vs green/red

### 3. **Always First**
- "You Are Here" marker is ALWAYS placed first
- Route line starts from this marker
- It's the origin point of your entire trip

## Technical Details

### Marker Construction

**SVG Animation:**
```svg
<svg width="40" height="40">
  <!-- Outer pulsing ring -->
  <circle cx="20" cy="20" r="18" fill="#0ea5e9" opacity="0.3">
    <animate attributeName="r" from="15" to="20" dur="1.5s" 
             repeatCount="indefinite"/>
    <animate attributeName="opacity" from="0.5" to="0.1" dur="1.5s" 
             repeatCount="indefinite"/>
  </circle>
  
  <!-- Middle ring -->
  <circle cx="20" cy="20" r="12" fill="#0ea5e9" opacity="0.6"/>
  
  <!-- Inner white ring -->
  <circle cx="20" cy="20" r="8" fill="white" 
          stroke="#0ea5e9" stroke-width="3"/>
  
  <!-- Center dot -->
  <circle cx="20" cy="20" r="4" fill="#0ea5e9"/>
</svg>
```

**CSS Animation:**
```css
@keyframes pulse-marker {
  0%   { transform: scale(1);   opacity: 1; }
  50%  { transform: scale(1.1); opacity: 0.8; }
  100% { transform: scale(1);   opacity: 1; }
}

.custom-icon.current {
  animation: pulse-marker 2s ease-in-out infinite;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.6));
}
```

### Color Choice
- **#0ea5e9** - Sky Blue
  - Distinct from green (pickup) and red (dropoff)
  - Stands out on map background
  - Associated with "location" and "navigation"
  - High visibility without being jarring

---

## Browser Compatibility

The pulsing animation works on:
- ✅ Chrome 80+ (full animation support)
- ✅ Firefox 75+ (full animation support)
- ✅ Safari 13+ (full animation support)
- ✅ Edge 80+ (full animation support)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (smooth performance)

**Note:** If animations are disabled in browser settings, the marker will still appear but won't pulse.

---

## Accessibility

### For Users with Visual Impairments:
- High contrast blue vs white
- Large size (40px) for visibility
- Distinct from other markers

### For Users with Motion Sensitivity:
- Gentle, slow pulse (2 seconds)
- Not rapid or jarring
- Can be turned off via browser settings

---

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Missing Current Location Indicator):
```
❌ All markers looked similar
❌ Hard to tell where you are
❌ Green marker for start looked like pickup
❌ No visual distinction for "current"
```

### After (With "You Are Here" Marker):
```
✅ Bright blue pulsing marker stands out
✅ Clearly shows "You Are Here"
✅ Different from all other marker types
✅ Animated for immediate attention
✅ Larger size for easy spotting
```
