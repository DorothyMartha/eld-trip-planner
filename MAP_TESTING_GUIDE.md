# ELD Map Testing Guide

## How the Map Now Works

### âœ… **Fixed Issues**

1. **Dynamic Route Lines**: The route line now connects ALL locations in the correct order:
   - Current Location (Starting Point) â†’ Pickup â†’ Intermediate Stops â†’ Dropoff

2. **Proper Marker Placement**: Each location is marked correctly:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Starting location (Current Location)
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Pickup location  
   - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Dropoff location (Final Destination)
   - ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Fuel stops
   - ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Rest periods

3. **Map Updates Dynamically**: When you change locations, the map automatically:
   - Updates marker positions
   - Redraws the route line
   - Re-centers the view
   - Refreshes all data

## Testing the Map

### Test Scenario 1: Simple Route (NYC to LA)
**Input:**
- Current Location: `New York`
- Pickup Location: `New York`
- Dropoff Location: `Los Angeles`
- Current Cycle Used: `20`

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Green marker at New York
- âœ… Red marker at Los Angeles
- âœ… Orange line connecting both cities
- âœ… Map centered on the route
- âœ… Multiple fuel/rest stops shown along the route

### Test Scenario 2: Three-City Route (Miami â†’ Chicago â†’ Seattle)
**Input:**
- Current Location: `Miami`
- Pickup Location: `Chicago`
- Dropoff Location: `Seattle`
- Current Cycle Used: `15`

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Green marker at Miami (start)
- âœ… Green marker at Chicago (pickup)
- âœ… Red marker at Seattle (dropoff)
- âœ… Orange line: Miami â†’ Chicago â†’ Seattle
- âœ… Intermediate fuel/rest stops

### Test Scenario 3: Short Route (Boston â†’ Philadelphia)
**Input:**
- Current Location: `Boston`
- Pickup Location: `Boston`
- Dropoff Location: `Philadelphia`
- Current Cycle Used: `5`

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Green marker at Boston
- âœ… Red marker at Philadelphia
- âœ… Short orange line connecting them
- âœ… Fewer intermediate stops (shorter distance)

## How to Verify Map is Working

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
Looking up: "New York" -> "new_york"
Found coordinates for New York: [40.7128, -74.0060]
Route coordinates: [[40.7128, -74.0060], [34.0522, -118.2437]]
Route markers: [{...}, {...}]
```

### 2. Visual Verification
âœ… **Markers appear at correct locations**
- Green marker = Start/Pickup
- Red marker = Dropoff
- Blue markers = Fuel stops
- Purple markers = Rest stops

âœ… **Orange line connects all markers**
- Line should flow from start â†’ pickup â†’ stops â†’ dropoff

âœ… **Map is properly centered**
- All markers should be visible
- Route should be clearly visible

âœ… **Popups work when clicking markers**
- Shows location name
- Shows timing information
- Shows distance (if applicable)
- Shows duty status badge

### 3. Test Different Location Combinations

Try these combinations to verify dynamic updates:

| Test | Current | Pickup | Dropoff | Should See |
|------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| 1 | New York | New York | Los Angeles | Cross-country route |
| 2 | Miami | Atlanta | Seattle | Diagonal route |
| 3 | Chicago | Chicago | Detroit | Short route |
| 4 | Phoenix | Denver | Boston | Multi-region route |
| 5 | Seattle | Portland | San Diego | West coast route |

### 4. Debug Unknown Cities

If you enter a city not in the database:
- Check console for: `No coordinates found for [City Name]`
- The city will be added to nearest match or skipped
- Consider adding the city to `getCityCoordinates()` function

## Adding New Cities

To add a new city, edit `RouteMap.js`:

```javascript
const getCityCoordinates = () => {
  return {
    // ... existing cities ...
    'your_city': [latitude, longitude],
    'yourcity': [latitude, longitude], // Variant without underscore
  };
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Map doesn't update when changing locations
**Solution:** The map now has a `key` prop that forces re-render on data changes. This should work automatically.

### Problem: Markers appear in wrong locations
**Solution:** Check the console logs to see if the city is being found. Add city variations to the database.

### Problem: No line connecting markers
**Solution:** Ensure at least 2 locations are entered. Check that coordinates are being found for both locations.

### Problem: Map shows blank/gray tiles
**Solution:** 
- Check internet connection (tiles load from OpenStreetMap)
- Check browser console for network errors
- Try refreshing the page

## Advanced Features

### Console Debugging
Enable detailed logging by checking the browser console. The map logs:
- City lookups and matches
- Coordinate assignments
- Route building process
- Marker creation

### Route Line Customization
The route line is styled with:
- **Color**: Orange (#f97316) - Matches ELD theme
- **Weight**: 4px - Clearly visible
- **Opacity**: 0.8 - Semi-transparent for aesthetics

### Marker Icons
Custom SVG icons for each type:
- Designed to be clear and recognizable
- Color-coded for quick identification
- Shadows for depth and visibility

## Performance Notes

- Map re-renders only when trip data changes
- Coordinates are cached during lookup
- Markers are generated efficiently
- No unnecessary re-renders

**The map is now production-ready and will dynamically update based on the locations you enter!** ðŸŽ‰
